                <h3>Our story</h3>
                <p>Founded in 2010, Ameiz Lingua World was born from a passion for languages and a vision to create an educational environment where students could truly immerse themselves in new cultures while learning to communicate effectively.</p>

                <p> Our founder, Emeribe stanley ameiz, a polyglot who speaks six languages fluently, recognized that traditional language learning methods often fell short of providing the practical skills needed for real-world communication. She assembled a team of dedicated language enthusiasts and professional educators to develop a methodology that emphasizes conversation, cultural context, and personalized learning </p>
                    
                <p>Today, we've grown from a small studio with just two languages to a comprehensive language school offering courses in over 12 languages. We've helped more than 5,000 students achieve their language learning goals, whether for travel, business, relocation, or personal enrichment.</p>
